Intro: The Movie Lab program is capable of either processing an image and using a filter to convert it into a video, or applying a filter to an existing video. The program uses dynamic data structures to store all the frames and images of the videos. Each image is stored in a dynammically allocated structure and then placed into a doublely linked list to create the string of images that makes up the frames of a movie. The program inputs video files in yuv format and images in ppm format.

Usage:

1. Apply filter to an image:
	This allows you to apply either a hue rotation or saturation incrementally to an image to create a video.

	MovieLab -i [image file name] -o [ouput movie name] -start= [starting filter value] -end= [ending filter value] -step= [increment of filter] [-hue for hue rotation or -saturate for saturation]

2. Apply filter to a video:
	This allows you to reverse a video and output the new file.

	MovieLab -m [input video name] -o [output file name] -f [number of frames] -s [width]x[height] -reverse
