/* Program Description */

Created a Connect Four program that allows two players to either play the standard connect four game, or a variation with an anvil chip.Project features ascii menus, color graphics, and input to play through the games.

/* Implimentation */

In order to impliment the connect four game, I first used a two-dimensional array data structure to store the game board data. The array is initiallzed to zeros  which represents open spaces. A '1' represents player 1 chip, a '2' represents player 2 chip, and '3' represents the anvil chip. Functions were created to handle the graphics formatting and user prompts. The turn functions handle to the player turns and places a chip in the correct location.

In order to check for the win condition of four chips in a row, I used a separate function that was called after every turn. The function would start at the location of the newly entered chip, and iterate through all 8 possible directions around the chip. In each direction, the function checks for a matching chip in both the forward and reverese and totals the number of adjacent chips for that direction. If this is at least 4 chips, the player wins. With this method, I do not need to iterate through the entire board, thus saving execution cylces and time.
